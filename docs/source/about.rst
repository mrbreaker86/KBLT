Kitchen-Based Light Tomography (KBLT) is a DIY toolkit for advancing tomography developed by and for the tomography community. Instead of using X-rays or neutrons, a strong LED flashlight (visible light) is used as a light source. To demonstrate the capabilities of KBLT, both non-transparent and transparent objects were scanned under both static (3D) and dynamic (4D) acquisition modes, also in combination with sample environments, thus modifying the sample during scanning.

– The KBLT can be used by tomography users - for education and training, prior to carrying out a real X-ray or neutron tomography experiment.

– The KBLT will be useful for beamline scientists - for testing and implementing new hardware and software solutions, in situations where the X-ray or neutron beam is not available.

– The KBLT will allow computational researchers working with algorithm development, e.g., image reconstruction, image processing and analysis to test their algorithms on easily-generated KBLT datasets, both in 3D and 4D.

– Building and collaborating on this open-source KBLT project is foreseen to aid, develop and strengthen the international tomography community.
